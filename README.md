# Project-1
This repository includes files for project #1 - The goal of this project is to assist UNMC Water, Climate, and Health Group in examining air quality conditions throughout Nebraska using data given from AirPurple sensors gathered between the dates of February 2024 and March 2025

The client wants an analysis to determine if air quality in Nebraska meets National Ambient Air Quality Standards, and if it does not, to provide potential hotspots in the area looking at highest concentrations of VOC, PM 2.5, and PM 10.0. Looking at potential hotspots they want to know times when Air Quality Index is at a level of risk for sensitive populations and the cause. Lastly, they want to examine the impact of environmental variables, including temperature and humidity.
